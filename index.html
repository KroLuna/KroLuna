  <h1>What is Scrum</h1>
  <p>
    Scrum is a <a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/framework">framework</a>
that helps people, teamworks and others to effektively find solutions to complex problems.
Scrum was created by Ken Schwaber and Jeff Sutherland in the early 90's and it was presented in 1995. They have written the <a href="https://scrumguides.org/">Scrum Guide</a> to help people understand Scrum.
</p>
<p>
  It is an empirical process, meaning that we adapt to our team so our team works as efficiently as it goes. 
  We make changes to improve and the team is constantly learning and adapting.
</p>
<p>There are <a href="https://scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#scrum-theory">three factors</a> that are important in Scrum and those are:
</p>
<ul><p>Transparency</p>
<p>Adaptation</p>
<p>Inspection</p></ul>
<p>The Scrum <a href=https://scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#scrum-values>values</a> are:</p>
<ul><p>Courage</p>
  <p>Focus</p>
  <p>Commitment</p>
<p>Respect</p>
<p>Openness</p></ul>
<p>There is always a <a href=https://scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#scrum-team>Scrum Team</a> with between 3 to 9 members, were one of them is the Scrum Master, the other is the Product Owner and then the developers.
